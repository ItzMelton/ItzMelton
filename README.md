d.js, Lua, & C# programmer       

I make TShock plugins on mobile, which is pretty strange because most people use a PC/Laptop, but I just push through and code straight from my mobile devices.

我是华人，但我住在国外，所以并不是每天都接触中文。也因为这样，我的中文不太流利。我最常用、最习惯的语言其实是英文。        
I'm Chinese, but I live in another country, so I didn't grow up speaking Chinese every day, and i'm not very fluent in Chinese. English is actually the language I speak the most and feel most comfortable using.
